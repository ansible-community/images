# Ansible Community Execution Environment Images

## About Execution Environments

Execution environments (EE) are container images from which your Ansible commands and playbooks run from.
They are meant to include the Ansible collections, packages and dependencies you need for running Ansible modules and playbooks.

They can be used by [AWX](https://github.com/ansible/awx), [Automation Controller](https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/administration/index.html) (previously known as Tower) and [ansible-navigator](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-navigator).

They can be built using [ansible-builder](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-builder/) with either [docker or podman](https://ansible-builder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/#container-runtime) using [execution environment definitions](https://ansible-builder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/definition/) provided by this repository.

## Important ⚠️
